## Getting Started

1. Create the project

```sh
gatsby new gatsby-amplify-auth https://github.com/dabit3/gatsby-auth-starter-aws-amplify
```

2. Change into the new directory

```sh
cd gatsby-amplify-auth
```

3. Change into the new directory

```sh
yarn
# or
npm install
```

4. Install & configure the AWS Amplify CLI. Note: we're going to be using the multi environment CLI version as it is the newest version.

```sh
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli@multienv

amplify configure
```

5. Create a new AWS Amplify Project

```
amplify init
```

> Here, walk through the following steps:

- Enter a name for the project __YOURPROJECTNAME__
- Enter a name for the environment __master__
- Choose your default editor: __Visual Studio Code__ (or your editor of choice)
- Choose the type of app that you're building __javascript__
- What javascript framework are you using __react__
- Source Directory Path: __src__
- Distribution Directory Path: __public__
- Build Command: __npm run-script build__
- Start Command: __npm run-script develop__

6. Push the updated project configuration to AWS. It will deploy a CloudFormation template that has an Amazon Cognito resource that enables user authentication.

```sh
amplify push
```

7. Then you can run it by:
```sh
gatsby develop
```

## Hosting with the AWS Amplify Console

The AWS Amplify Console provides continuous deployment and hosting for modern web apps (single page apps and static site generators). Continuous deployment allows developers to deploy updates to their web app on every code commit to their Git repository. If the build succeeds, the app is deployed and hosted on a global CDN with an *amplifyapp.com* domain. The Amplify Console offers globally available CDNs, easy custom domain setup, feature branch deployments, and password protection.

1. Push your code to a Git repository of your choice.
1. Login to the [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home) and choose **Connect app**
1. Connect your repository and branch.
1. Accept the default build settings.
1. Give the Amplify Console permission to deploy backend resources with your frontend. This will allow the Console to detect changes to your backend on every code commit. If you do not have a service role, follow the prompts to create one.
1. Review your changes and then choose **Save and deploy**. You app will now be available at `https://master.unique-id.amplifyapp.com`.

You can now continuously deploy changes to your frontend or backend and Amplify will automatically deploy those changes.
